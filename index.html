<h2> Khan Anik Rahman </h2> 

<h4> Electrical Engineer | Documentation Specialist | IELTS Trainer </h4>

<p align = "justify"> I am an electrical engineer with a master's in renewable energy. I believe in continuous learning and using one's knowledge and experiences to make today's world a bit more better than how it was tomorrow. I love teaching, programming, and being involved in academic research. </p>

<p align = "justify"> My academic interests include but are not limited to: Electronics, Renewable Energy, Automation, Image Processing Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. </p>

<h2> About Me </h2>

<h4> Love for Engineering </h4>

<p align = "justify"> I have been fascinated by engineering pretty much all my life. From a very young age, I loved tinkering with little scientific experiments from my textbooks: from forcing my parents to buy litmus paper to taking apart my sister's toys to see the circuits disregarding the scolding to come thereafter, I had an unfathomable love to understand the ins and outs of technology. By the time I was in high school, I became certain about pursuing electrical engineering for my bachelor's. As a result in 2013, I enrolled in Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, specifically in the electrical and electronic engineering department. I am grateful that I got to learn from such wonderful teachers who were always ready to go the extra mile to make sure we get the best education possible. During my 4 years, I acquired in-depth knowledge in the fields of Network Theory, Semiconductor Devices, Power Electronics, Power Systems, Programming, and Image Processing. </p>

<p align = "justify"> I've always prioritized gaining a deeper understanding of whatever I am learning or doing since a very early age. By the time I graduated in 2017, I became certain that I want to pursue a path of constant learning whether I start a job or get into academia. I sat for the MS entrance exam of the Institute of Energy, University of Dhaka in July 2017, which is one of the most recognized post-graduate degrees in the country, and was able to secure 7th position among 2200 examinees. I consider the duration of my MS, from 2017 - 2019, to be one of the most important 2 years of my life. I had great peers, teachers, and a wonderful supervisor who made this journey one I will cherish forever. Some of the courses I really enjoyed were climatology, research methodology, electrical properties of PV cells, and energy economics.</p> 

<h4> A Passionate Teacher </h4> 

<p align = "justify"> If there is something I unconditionally love other than my family members, it's certainly teaching. I started tutoring students in 2013 when I was a 1st-year undergraduate student. From 2013 - 2019, I personally taught more than 300 students personally, in batches, and virtually. I got the opportunity to teach the underprivileged children of our country through the Teach for Bangladesh fellowship. I also worked as an IELTS trainer at Mentor's, a leading test prep company in the country. I still work with graduate and post-graduate students regarding IELTS preparation, Physics, Math, MATLAB, and Python programming. I have even taught children how to play the piano and the drums. In some ways, I have learned more from teaching other people than being a student myself. </p>

<h4> A Debater </h4>

<p align = "justify"> I have been involved with debating since I was 10 years old. By the time I was 12, I was appointed as the joint secretary of Ideal Debating Club (IDC), my school's debating club. Eventually, I became the vice-president and later the general secretary of the club. I regularly organized work-shops, national debate festivals, and participated in adjudication for different institutions. I along with my 2 teammates formed one of the most prominent school debate teams of the country amassing more than 30 championships, 20 runner-ups, and numerous individual trophies. I also worked as the joint secretary and general secretary of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology Debating Club. Apart from carrying out the obvious responsibilities, my committee was responsible for the first-ever national debate festival in the university's history. Notwithstanding all the accolades and achievements, the most valuable thing being a debater got me is the ability to think logically and reason rationally in the toughest of situations.</p>
