<h2> My 2021 Resolution </h2>
<p style = "color:gray"> January 1, 2021 

<p align = "justify"> So it's finally the end of the year. Time to make amends and look towards new beginnings. 
On a personal note, I had a decent year. I was able to take care of my loved ones, work has been going fairly well, did not have to deal with any significant health concerns; was a neat year overall; can't complain really! Although, I should have focused a bit more on studies. This is the thing which has to change the most in 2021. 
However, while thinking about my own year, I realized my resolutions were pretty general in nature and sharing those here might benefit others as well.

Well, here goes nothing: <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

<br>
<br>

1. Take care of the people who matter: Please take care of your loved ones. No matter what, one day all of us will go away. They are the ones who will remember you for your deeds and the memories with them. Take care of your parents, siblings, and the friends who matter the most to you. Remember, you are not taking care of them, rather you are taking care of your own soul. In the process, be mindful enough to take care of your own physical and mental health. You can't do anything unless you are in tip top shape. 

<br>
<br>

2. Learn more: This is so important! Your brain needs regular exercise. Read something every day. Don't only focus on learning with online videos. Try to vary your learning processes but go forward with particular goals and checkpoints. This will make you more functional and more agile to tackle every day challenges that life throws at you. Your brain and memory are really important for your future endeavours, remember that. 

<br>
<br>

3. Be kind: Help out others. Be there if they ask for help. Try to be more humane. There is a very good chance you won't be able to spend all your money or energy in this life. If you can work a bit harder to make thousands of lives better, do that. Be someone who people unconditionally love. Don't only go on "reacting love" in people's posts. Stand beside them when it actually matters. 

<br>
<br>

4. Be competitive, not jealous: Try to excel in whatever you are doing. But, always try to be wary of the fine line between jealousy and competition. Try to help the people around you. This will only hone your skills, trust me. Nobody can steal your talent. So help others! Be the best you can be, but don't be an idiot in the process! 

<br>
<br>

5. Be thankful: Don't get upset over every failure. In fact, you will definitely fail, suffer, and you might even lose your loved ones. You know what? It's okay. Life is hard. However, make sure to pull yourself up every time and see every story to the end with all your might. Be a beast! Nothing can stop you. It's your story, you're the protagonist, carpe diem!

<br>
<br>

That's all from me for the day. Have a wonderful 2021 you absolute legends! </span></p>
